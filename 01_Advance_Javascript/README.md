 # Asynchronous Javasript

 - Javascript has a Synchronous behaviour by default
 - Javascript is a single threaded language

 
 # Difference b/w Synchronous and Asynchronous 

 - Synchronous : In Synchronous  behaviour code excute line by line. If a line of code takes time to execute the flow of execution will be stopped for the rest of the code 

 - Asynchronous : In Asynchronous behaviour code execute line by line but It doesn't wait any line to be executed first. 

 # Memory
